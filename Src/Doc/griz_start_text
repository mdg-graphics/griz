                      Updated: 6/25/96

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New functionality
    Colormap value scale - The colormap now displays a
    scale of values along its left side.  Scale values are
    selected to fall on "round" values between the result
    min and max (including zero, for example).  An
    alternative implementation could always pick a set
    number of scale values equally spaced between the min
    and max and let the values fall where they may.  If
    you have any feedback, please submit it to Doug Speck
    or Larry Sanford.
    
    Rendered text is now anti-aliased.
    
    <Ctrl><mouse pick>
        Picking an element while the Control key is 
	depressed will select or deselect the element's
	material in the Material Manager.  The element is 
	not hilited or selected.  If the Material Manager
	is not up, an information dialog pops up stating
	this fact.  <Ctrl>-picking a node pops up a 
	dialog telling the user to pick an element.

    <Shift><mouse pick>
        Picking a node or element while the Shift key is
	depressed effects a "tellpos" query on the picked
	object.  No hilite or selection occurs.
