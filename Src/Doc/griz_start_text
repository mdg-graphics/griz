                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New results
    Volumetric Strain - "evol"
        This derived result is the natural log of the
	relative volume.

    Seven results formerly available only for brick
    elements are now available for shell elements as well.
    They are:
        "Prin Dev Stress 1" ("pdev1"), 
        "Prin Dev Stress 2" ("pdev2"), 
        "Prin Dev Stress 3" ("pdev3"), 
        "Maximum Shear Stress" ("maxshr"), 
        "Principal Stress 1", ("prin1"),
        "Principal Stress 2", ("prin2"), and
        "Principal Stress 3", ("prin3").
    These results are now found in the "Shared" result
    menu.

New commands
    bbox vis
        Calculate a new bounding box for the mesh based
	upon the extents only of visible materials.  The
	"rnf" command attempts to reset the near/far
	clipping planes on the basis of the Z-extents of
	the bounding box.  At large scale factors, the
	bounding box may extend behind the visualization
	eyepoint, causing the "rnf" command to fail.  This
	new variation of the "bbox" command allows the user
	to calculate a potentially smaller bounding box
	which may allow the "rnf" command to succeed in
	those cases.

    bufqty {all | n | h | s | b} <buffer quantity>
        Set the number of states' data which is buffered
	in memory for a particular mesh object type
	("n" for nodes, "h" for hex elements, "s" for
	shells, and "b" for beams), or for all types, to
	avoid redundant disk accesses during result
	computation.  By default, one states' data is 
	buffered ("bufqty all 1").  Former behavior was 
	equivalent to "bufqty all 0", in which no data is
	buffered.  Buffering data can lead to significant
	speedups for result computations which require
	as inputs several primal results from the plotfile
	database.  With no buffering, each primal result
	causes disk access.  If viewing results at 
	interpolated time values, a buffer quantity of two
	can offer further performance improvement by 
	limiting or eliminating disk accesses for some 
	time values.  For most users, there's probably no 
	advantage in ever setting the buffer quantity 
	above two.

New functionality
    View centering ("vcent...") now centers the mesh in Z
    as well as X and Y, automatically positioning the
    depth of the mesh to keep the view centering point
    centered between the near and far clipping planes.
    This can be useful when applying large scale factors
    that cause the mesh to (apparently) disappear.  A
    side-effect of this functionality is that issuing an
    "rnf" command with view centering on can result in
    a sudden jump forward or backward of the mesh as it
    is re-centered between the new near/far clipping 
    planes.
    
    The warning popup dialog for an "rnf" failure has
    been re-written to be more helpful.
    
Bug fix
    Updated effective stress calculation for hex's and
    shells with a re-derived expression that avoids the 
    possibility of a negative input to the sqrt() function.  
    This was causing crashes under UNICOS.
