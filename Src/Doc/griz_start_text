                      Updated: 4/9/96

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New functionality
    <Ctrl><mouse pick>
        Picking an element while the Control key is 
	depressed will select or deselect the element's
	material in the Material Manager.  The element is 
	not hilited or selected.  If the Material Manager
	is not up, an information dialog pops up stating
	this fact.  <Ctrl>-picking a node pops up a 
	dialog telling the user to pick an element.

    <Shift><mouse pick>
        Picking a node or element while the Shift key is
	depressed effects a "tellpos" query on the picked
	object.  No hilite or selection occurs.
	
Changed commands
    telem -> tellem
        For consistency with other "tell..." commands, 
	the correct form to report exploded view material
	associations is "tellem", although "telem" is,
	for the time being, still accepted.

Bug fixes
    Data is now re-gathered for time histories when
    plotting a result a second time after changing the
    basis, reference surface, or strain variety (if the
    result is affected by any of those parameters).
    Previously, Griz only checked the result id of
    previously-gathered results when determining whether
    or not to re-gather, so it could incorrectly display
    a result calculated with a different setting of one
    of the affecting parameters.
    
    There was a time history plotting bug in which the y-
    axis tics would be labeled incorrectly if the min and
    max y-values were not exactly equal but differed only
    in the sixth or seventh significant figure.  This is
    fixed.
    
    When rendering at an interpolated time (the "time"
    command), the time displayed in the window was the time
    for the last state preceding the interpolated time.
    The interpolated time is now displayed.
    
    Related to the above bug, when displaying an 
    interpolated time and the "p" command was given, the
    next state displayed was the last state preceding the
    interpolated time minus one.  Now, the last state
    preceding the interpolated time is displayed.
    
    If the foreground color wasn't black, the element
    edge lines in "hidden" mesh mode could be shaded
    incorrectly.  They are now shaded correctly.

of GRIZ 2.0 changes.
