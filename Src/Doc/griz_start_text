                      Updated: 4/3/98

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0
                     
New functionality
    Griz has an initial capability to detect and read
    LS-Dyna plot databases.  Due to conflicts in the 
    interpretation of certain control words between
    Livermore Software and MDG codes, it's uncertain how
    robust this initial capability is, but we will
    continue to refine it as necessary.

New commands
    inrgb [bg] <rgb filename>
        Load the indicated rgb image file into memory.  If
        the "bg" switch is not given, the image is
        immediately loaded into the framebuffer and freed
        from memory.  The image will stay in the window
        until any activity causes Griz to redraw.  If the
        "bg" switch is given, the image is not immediately 
        loaded into the framebuffer but is saved 
        indefinitely for use as an alternative background 
        in the rendering window.  To employ the image as a 
        background use the "on bgimage" command (below).
        Whenever an rgb image is loaded into the 
        framebuffer, the lower left corner of the image is
        placed at the lower left corner of the rendering
        window.  If in any dimension the image is larger
        than the window, the image is cropped.  If in any
        dimension the window is larger than the image, the
        extra space is filled in the current background
        color ("setcol bg <r> <g> <b>").
    on/off bgimage
        Turn on (off) utilization of the current background 
        rgb image as the background for the rendering 
        window.  If no image is currently loaded into
        memory, there is no effect, but as soon as a
        subsequent "inrgb bg <file>" command is parsed, the
        loaded image will immediately show up in the 
        background.
    dirv <x component> <y component> [<z component>]
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system.
    dir3n <node 1> <node 2> <node 3>
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system as the normal to a plane defined by the 
        positions of three mesh nodes at the current state 
        (right-hand rule determines positive direction).
    dir3p <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x3> <y3> <z3>
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system as the normal to a plane defined by the
        three specified points (right-hand rule applies).

New result
    Projected Vector Magnitude - "pvmag"
        This nodal result requires that both a direction 
        vector ("dirv", "dir3n", or "dir3p" commands) and a
        vector result ("vec" command) be defined.  Given 
        those, "pvmag" is the magnitude of the vector 
        value at each node when projected onto the defined 
        direction vector, i.e., the component of the vector
        in that direction.
        
        Example - The following commands would show the 
        magnitude of the displacement parallel to a line 
        midway between the X, Y, and Z axes:
            vec dispx dispy dispz
            dirv 1 1 1
            show pvmag

        When "pvmag" is the current result, the components
        forming the vector quantity are listed beneath
        the result title above the colormap, and the 
        current direction vector is rendered as a red line
        coming out of the origin of the coordinate system
        orientation display (The coordinate system 
        orientation is rendered when "on coord" or "on all" 
        are in effect).

Bug fixes
    The "getedg" command, executed after a material
    translation, now correctly generates a new edge set.
    
    The titles for shell results "res3" ("M_zz Bending
    Resultant") and "res8" ("N_zz Bending Resultant") have
    been corrected (to "M_xy Bending Resultant" and "N_xy
    Bending Resultant", respectively).
    
    Exposing the rendering window with refresh off will
    not cause a redraw.
