                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New commands
    tellmm [<result> [<first state> [<last state>]]]
        Generate a report of result min/max values, writing
	it to the feedback window.  With no parameters,
	tellmm generates a report for the currently
	displayed result over all states in the database.
	If only <result> is specified, the min/max values
	for that result over all states in the database are
	reported, so a report can be generated for any
	result, regardless of what is currently displayed
	on the mesh.  If <result> and <first state> are 
	specified, tellmm reports the min and max for the
	result at that state only.  If <last state> is
	also specified, tellmm reports the min/max values
	between <first state> and <last state>, inclusive.
	The report includes the element or node at which
	the min/max values occur as well as a summary
	giving the overall min and max for the states
	traversed for the report.
	
	Tellmm is like the globmm command in that it
	updates the cached global min/max for a particular
	result.  This means that, if "switch mglob" is in
	effect, a tellmm command may update the min and
	max values on the colorscale, causing a change in
	the appearance of the current fringe plot. 

Bug fixes
    "on/off ndnum" and "on/off elnum" have been fixed.
	    
See the file GRIZ_CHANGES, co-located with the Griz binary,
for a complete list of GRIZ 2.0 changes.
