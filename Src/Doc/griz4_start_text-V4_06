               ** Version 4.06 Release Notes **

                      Updated:01/20/06


************************************************************

This new release of GRIZ contains a variety of bug fixes and
ehnancements. Following is a summary of changes for this
release.


New Commands:

(1) Running Alpha or Beta Version of Griz: A feature has been added to Griz
    that will allow a user to run the latest Alpha or Beta version of Griz. 
    SCR#: 298

     Example: griz4s -alpha -i input
              griz4s -beta  -i input
     

 (2) Griz will now report the element numbers for elements with a zero
     volume.
     SCR#: 331

 (3) Griz can now manage and use intermediate results that do not
     have to be displayed in the pulldown menu.
     SCR#: 339

 (4) Free Nodes: Several ehnancements have been made to the free node
     capability. Any result can now be rendered for free nodes and a
     new derived result has been created to display the mass and
     volume of all free nodes for selected materials.
     SCR#: 365

     Example: on fn [scale 9.9] [res 5] [mass_scale on|off] 
                    [vol_scale on|off] [mat 1,2...]

     where: scale - Scaling factor to control nodes size.
            res   - Resolution to render nodes as spheres - higher 
                    number will make better looking nodes, but
                    increase rendering time.
            mass_scale - Nodes will be scaled by mass of contributing
                         elements. Default is on.          
            vol_scale -  Nodes will be scaled by volume of contributing
                         elements. Default is off.
            mat       -  Free nodes will be displayed for a list of
                         materials.    

     show [fnmass | fnvol]
