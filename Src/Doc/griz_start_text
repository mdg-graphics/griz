                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New commands
    dirv <x component> <y component> [<z component>]
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system.
    dir3n <node 1> <node 2> <node 3>
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system as the normal to a plane defined by the 
        positions of three mesh nodes at the current state 
        (right-hand rule determines positive direction).
    dir3p <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x3> <y3> <z3>
        Specifies a direction vector in the mesh coordinate
        system as the normal to a plane defined by the
        three specified points (right-hand rule applies).

New result
    Projected Vector Magnitude - "pvmag"
        This nodal result requires that both a direction 
        vector ("dirv", "dir3n", or "dir3p" commands) and a
        vector result ("vec" command) be defined.  Given 
        those, "pvmag" is the magnitude of the vector 
        value at each node when projected onto the defined 
        direction vector, i.e., the component of the vector
        in that direction.
        
        Example - The following commands would show the 
        magnitude of the displacement parallel to a line 
        midway between the X, Y, and Z axes:
            vec dispx dispy dispz
            dirv 1 1 1
            show pvmag

        When "pvmag" is the current result, the components
        forming the vector quantity are listed beneath
        the result title above the colormap, and the 
        current direction vector is rendered as a red line
        coming out of the origin of the coordinate system
        orientation display (The coordinate system 
        orientation is rendered when "on coord" or "on all" 
        are in effect).

Bug fixes
    The "getedg" command, executed after a material
    translation, now correctly generates a new edge set.
    
    The titles for shell results "res3" ("M_zz Bending
    Resultant") and "res8" ("N_zz Bending Resultant") have
    been corrected (to "M_xy Bending Resultant" and "N_xy
    Bending Resultant", respectively).
    
    Exposing the rendering window with refresh off will
    not cause a redraw.

See the file GRIZ_CHANGES, co-located with the Griz binary,
for a complete list of GRIZ 2.0 changes.
