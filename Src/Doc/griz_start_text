                      Updated: 10/28/96

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New commands
    conwid <width>
        Set the line width for isocontours. <width> is a
	floating point number greater than zero. Fractional
	widths are allowable, but actual resolution is
	platform dependent.  The default width is 1.0.
	
    on/off zlines   (Default: on)
        This controls whether or not antialiased lines
	(edge lines and beam elements) are depth-buffered
	with respect to each other.  With zlines on, they
	are depth-buffered and so render correctly in
	depth.  However, there are some rendering artifacts
	which appear in this mode which can be distracting
	during  video-animations.  With zlines off, those
	artifacts disappear but depth-buffering may be
	incorrect.  GRIZ PREVIOUSLY BEHAVED AS IF ZLINES
	WERE OFF.

    setcol rmin <red value> <green value> <blue value>
    setcol rmax <red value> <green value> <blue value>
        These allow users to set the result threshold
	colors used when "rmin" or "rmax" values are set.
	The initial default values are still the same
	(magenta for rmin and red for rmax).  Reloading the
	current colormap ("hotmap" command produces the
	standard hot-cold colormap) while rmin and/or rmax
	are active overwrites the current rmin and rmax
	colors with whatever is in the colormap; rmin/rmax
	colors set with "setcol" can be put back into the
	colormap by repeating the rmin or rmax command.
	All red/green/blue color values are on [0.0, 1.0].
	
New functionality
    Setting rmin or rmax values does not reset the current
    colormap, it just replaces the colors in the first
    and/or last entries of the current colormap with the
    current rmin/rmax colors.  Previously, using rmin or
    rmax with one of Griz's internal colormaps (hot-cold
    or grey-scale) caused the colormap to be reset to a
    hot-cold colormap variant.
    
    Using "switch mstat" or "switch mglob" does NOT
    override any rmin or rmax values currently in effect.

Bug fixes
    Output from the "outobj" command has been corrected.
    
    Errors which occur during rgb-file output (such as when
    attempting to overwrite an existing file) no longer 
    cause Griz to exit.
    
    The maximum number of materials has been increased to
    300. Griz exits with a diagnostic if it is given a mesh
    with more than the maximum number of materials, as this
    presently requires a re-compile to accommodate.
    
    Toggle button widgets in the Material Manager and 
    Utility Panel now refresh their appearance properly to
    reflect current state.  This error did not occur under
    IRIX 5.x, but did happen under IRIX 6.2 and Solaris.
    
    Colorscale labeling and color interpolation when result
    interpolation is turned off ("switch noterp") are now
    correct; "globmm" saves non-interpolated (element)
    values during its database traversal and colormapping
    with global results ("switch mglob") when "switch
    noterp" is in effect is correct; nodal result viewing
    is correct when "switch noterp" is in effect (nodal
    results never need to be interpolated so noterp/interp
    makes no difference); beam result color interpolation
    has been corrected (beams are always rendered without
    result interpolation, unlike other elements, but
    previously the non-interpolated min and max were
    erroneously limited to the min and max produced by
    by averaging element values to the nodes).
    
    View centering ("vcent...") during animations works.
    
    Meshes which contain both beam and shell elements now
    display the beams properly.
