                      Updated: 4/26/96

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

Bug fix
    Added depth-buffer bias to ensure edge lines are 
    always rendered in front of mesh polygons. This
    cures the tendency of coincident edge lines and
    polygons to "interleave" in Z (see new command
    "edgbias"). Also added similar treatment to beam 
    elements, since they are rendered as lines and
    are susceptible to the same effect. The bias for
    beams may be turned on or off (see new command
    "on/off bmbias"). (Speck)

New commands

    edgbias <bias value>
        Set the depth-buffer bias value used when
	rendering edge lines ("on edges").  The value
	should be a small positive number between zero
	and one.  The default is 0.005.  The value is
	clamped to [0,1]. Larger values of the bias
	increase the depth-offset between the edge lines
	and mesh polygons and may be necessary with
	lines that have a large Z-slope, but large biases
	also introduce unsightly artifacts at some edge
	line junctions, so a compromise is necessary.
	(Speck)

    on/off bmbias
        Turn on or off the use of depth-buffer bias
	when rendering beam elements.  The bias is
	on by default.  The value of the bias is not
	currently adjustable. (Speck)

New functionality
    <Ctrl><mouse pick>
        Picking an element while the Control key is 
	depressed will select or deselect the element's
	material in the Material Manager.  The element is 
	not hilited or selected.  If the Material Manager
	is not up, an information dialog pops up stating
	this fact.  <Ctrl>-picking a node pops up a 
	dialog telling the user to pick an element.

    <Shift><mouse pick>
        Picking a node or element while the Shift key is
	depressed effects a "tellpos" query on the picked
	object.  No hilite or selection occurs.
