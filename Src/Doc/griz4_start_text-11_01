************************************************************

This new release of GRIZ contains a variety of bug fixes and
enhancements. Following is a summary of changes for this
release:

New Commands/Featires 
 (1) Added all-but "allb~options to vis/invis ~ enable-disable commands.

 (2) Added command to allow viewing of inactive elements:
     "on showde"   -> show the deleted elements.
     "on showode"  -> show ONLY the deleted elements.

 (3) Added 2 commands to generate model geometry at the current state in 
     True Grid file format:
     "outgeom <filename>"   -> Write mesh geometry to a file.
     "outsgeom <filename>"  -> Write surface geometry to a file.

 (4)  Made input file selection more robust. User can now provide an 
      'A' file or state file on input line and Griz will open the file family.

 (5)  Better support for long primal lists.  Long lists of primals now display
      in row-column format instead of a single list that can go off the edge of the window.

     -checkresults
     -checkresult
     -cr

       Enables checking the result for each element for NAN. If NAN found a 
       warning is displayed and the result is set to 1.0e30.

 (10) Added command for identification of multiple Griz sessions.
      -gid  n
       Defines a unique session id for Griz (1>=n<=10).
       Each session will display different border colors.
