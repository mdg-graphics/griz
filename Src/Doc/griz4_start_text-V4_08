               ** Version 4.08 Release Notes **

                     ** Alpha Release **

                      Updated:04/24/07


************************************************************

This new release of GRIZ contains a variety of bug fixes and
enhancements. Following is a summary of changes for this
release:


 (1) Griz can now process multiple commands on an input line. 
     Each command must be separated by the ';' character.

     Example:
	state 1; zf .5; state 2
    (SCR#: 381)


 (2) Selection by object type (i.e. brick, shell, truss). 
     A new capability has been added to the commands 
     include/exclude, vis/invis, and enable/disable that gives
     the user greater control over object selection. Now any
     object type can be selected, such a single brick or shell;
     for example:

     invis elem brick 1-100 110-200
     invis elem shell all 
     vis   elem shell 1-10

     If no object type is specified, then materials are used
     for the selection list, for example to make mat 1 invis:

     invis 1


 (3) Two new zoom commands have been implemented:
     zf  - Zoom forward: Zooms in the current view by x.

     zb  - Zoom back:    Zooms back the current view by x.
 
     Example:
	   zf 2.5
	   zb 2.5

    (SCR#: 438)


 (4) Two new rendering modes have been implemented (see Griz GUI):
     switch wf  - Draw Wireframe.
     switch wft - Draw Wireframe Transparent.
    (SCR#: 437)


 (5) The current directory path is now displayed at the top of the
     render window.
     (SCR#: 441)


 (6) In the past Griz was only capable of rendering float or double
     results but not integer results. Griz can now render integer 
     results.
    (SCR#: 434)


 (7) Griz now treats particles independent of materials for selection 
     operations such as invis/vis and enable/disable.
    (SCR#: 434)

 (8) A new command was add to speed up rendering when resizing windows.
     It is call "suppress updates" or su.

     Example:
     	on su
	off su

    (SCR#: 448)


Note - The batch version of Griz is not available on all platforms!
