                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New results
    Volumetric Strain - "evol"
        This derived result is the natural log of the
	relative volume.
	
    Plastic strain rate
        By setting "switch rate" while the current result
	is Effective Plastic Strain ("eeff"), the derived
	result is the rate of change of "eeff".  This is
	calculated by a simple first order central 
	difference approximation.  Users should be aware
	that it will return a non-zero rate at times when
	"eeff" is itself zero if "eeff" at the next or
	previous time step is non-zero.
	
	When this calculation is in effect, the rendering
	window contains this annotation:
	    "Result type: Time derivative"
	This is to distinguish this result from the
	(correct) tensor strain rate calculation that is 
	performed on hex element strain results when
	"switch rate" is in effect.  For those strains,
	the annotation is "Strain Type: Rate".

    Seven results formerly available only for brick
    elements are now available for shell elements as well.
    They are:
        "Prin Dev Stress 1" ("pdev1"), 
        "Prin Dev Stress 2" ("pdev2"), 
        "Prin Dev Stress 3" ("pdev3"), 
        "Maximum Shear Stress" ("maxshr"), 
        "Principal Stress 1", ("prin1"),
        "Principal Stress 2", ("prin2"), and
        "Principal Stress 3", ("prin3").
    These results are now found in the "Shared" result
    menu.

Changed commands
    clrsel [{{node|n}|{beam|b}|{shell|s}|{brick|h}} <n>...]
        The "clrsel" command now optionally takes a list of
	node or element numbers to allow de-selections of a
	subset of currently selected objects.  (See "New
	functionality" below regarding de-selections with
	the mouse and cursor.)

New commands
    bbox vis
        Calculate a new bounding box for the mesh based
	upon the extents only of visible materials.  The
	"rnf" command attempts to reset the near/far
	clipping planes on the basis of the Z-extents of
	the bounding box.  At large scale factors, the
	bounding box may extend behind the visualization
	eyepoint, causing the "rnf" command to fail.  This
	new variation of the "bbox" command allows the user
	to calculate a potentially smaller bounding box
	which may allow the "rnf" command to succeed in
	those cases.

    bufqty {all | n | h | s | b} <buffer quantity>
        Set the number of states' data which is buffered
	in memory for a particular mesh object type
	("n" for nodes, "h" for hex elements, "s" for
	shells, and "b" for beams), or for all types, to
	avoid redundant disk accesses during result
	computation.  By default, one states' data is 
	buffered ("bufqty all 1").  Former behavior was 
	equivalent to "bufqty all 0", in which no data is
	buffered.  Buffering data can lead to significant
	speedups for result computations which require
	as inputs several primal results from the plotfile
	database.  With no buffering, each primal result
	causes disk access.  
	
	When viewing results at interpolated time values, 
	a buffer quantity of two can offer further 
	performance improvement by limiting or eliminating 
	disk accesses for some time values.  There are 
	other analysis patterns which can benefit from
	using two buffers, and unless memory is an issue
	users may wish to make that their normal operating
	mode.  For most users, there's probably no advantage
	in ever setting the buffer quantity above two.
	
    on/off lighting
        Turn on or off use of lighting calculation to shade
	mesh polygons of 3D meshes.  By default, lighting
	is on.  With lighting off, shading of facets is 
	independent of their orientation.  This can allow
	more accurate interpretation of color fringes, but
	spatial orientation cues provided by lit facets are
	lost.  Rendering time is approximately 10 percent
	faster with lighting off.

    minmov <pixel distance>
        The minmov command provides a cursor motion margin 
	of error for node/element picks. It sets a threshold 
	distance the cursor must be moved with the mouse 
	before GRIZ treats the motion as intentional 
	manipulation of the mesh.  Continuous moves totaling 
	less than the threshold distance, when the mouse 
	button is released, are treated as node/element 
	picks (with the pick position being the cursor 
	position when the mouse button was first depressed). 
	

New functionality
    View centering ("vcent...") now centers the mesh in Z
    as well as X and Y, automatically positioning the
    depth of the mesh to keep the view centering point
    centered between the near and far clipping planes.
    This can be useful when applying large scale factors
    that cause the mesh to (apparently) disappear.  A
    side-effect of this functionality is that issuing an
    "rnf" command with view centering on can result in
    a sudden jump forward or backward of the mesh as it
    is re-centered between the new near/far clipping 
    planes.
    
    The warning popup dialog for an "rnf" failure has
    been re-written to be more helpful.
    
    Results that are affected by the element reference
    frame, strain type, or shell surface now have
    annotations giving the current settings of those
    parameters appended to their Y-axis labels on
    time history plots.
    
    Reference surface definition files can now optionally
    specify a material number on the first line after
    the face count.  By specifying a material number
    other than the actual material for the elements
    providing the reference surface faces, the user can
    (1) unlink the reference surface from translations of 
    the actual material and (2) control the color of the 
    reference surface independently of the actual material.
    The material number specified in the reference surface
    file can be any number less than or equal to the 
    maximum number of materials allowed (currently 300).  
    If the material number is one of the actual materials 
    in the mesh, the reference surface will be tied to 
    translations of that material.  In all cases, whether 
    or not a material number is specified, if "switch 
    gterp" is in effect, a result will be rendered on the 
    reference surface unless the material is disabled (even
    if "off refres" is in effect - this is a flaw in the
    existing "on/off refres" logic).
    
    If "on title" is in effect, the title is rendered on
    time history plots.
    
    Node and element picks (hilites or selects) with the
    mouse and cursor are now toggles - the first pick
    selects (or hilites), another pick de-selects 
    (de-hilites).
    
    The default font for the GUI has been changed to a
    font which is widely supported across vendors.
    
Bug fixes
    Updated effective stress calculation for hex's and
    shells with a re-derived expression that avoids the 
    possibility of a negative input to the sqrt() function.  
    This was causing crashes under UNICOS.
    
    Switching among strain types when the current result
    is NOT sensitive to strain type no longer causes the
    colorscale min/max values to be updated to the current
    state's min/max values.
    
    Calculation of hex strains when "switch rate" is in
    effect has been made approximately five times faster
    by restructuring the logic to eliminate redundant 
    disk accesses.
    
    View centering on a node or element now takes 
    displacement scaling ("dscal", "dscalx", etc.) into
    account.  Note that when centering the view on an 
    arbitrary point in space, displacement scale factors 
    have no effect.
