                      Updated: 7/23/96

                     WELCOME TO GRIZ 2.0

New commands
    fracsz <qty digits>
        Set the number of digits to render after the decimal
	point on the colormap scale, node/element min/max
	values, result values on selected nodes/elements,
	and on time-history plot axis scales.  This does
	NOT override "on autosz" on time-history plots.
	Set to two by default.
	
    on/off autosz
        With "autosz" on, Griz will automatically calculate
	the number of decimal digits to render on time-
	history plot axis scales so that numeric
	differences between adjacent values will be 
	resolved with a minimal number of digits.  The 
	number of digits after the decimal point is bounded 
	to [1,6].  This feature is on by default.
	
    on/off bbmax
        With "bbmax" on, Griz defines the mesh bounding box
	by only the largest displacement magnitude values 
	experienced across all invocations of the "bbox" 
	command.  The intent of this is that, by invoking 
	"bbox" at appropriate states, one can set the 
	bounding box, and by derivation the mesh view, to a 
	size that will encompass the mesh regardless of 
	displacement.  However, if explicit box values are 
	given with the "bbox" command, they will be used 
	regardless of "bbmax" setting.  This feature is off
	by default.
	
New functionality
    The Griz cursor changes shape to provide user feedback
    during various operations.  This functionality can be
    added to any Griz operation, and users are welcome to
    make suggestions if they note a relatively slow
    operation during which it would be appropriate to change
    the cursor shape (to a watch, for example).

Bug fixes
    Griz now recognizes and reads LLNL Topaz databases,
    accessing nodal temperature correctly.
	    
See the file /public/Griz/CHANGES_2.0 for an up-to-date list
of GRIZ 2.0 changes.
